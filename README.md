# Breast_Cancer_Prediction

Predicting breast cancer using logistic regression involves several steps. We'll use a popular dataset for this task: the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. This dataset is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is also included in the sklearn library.

Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing a logistic regression model for breast cancer prediction:
1.Import Necessary Libraries
2.Load and Explore the Dataset
3.Preprocess the Data
4.Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
5.Train a Logistic Regression Model
6.Evaluate the Model
7.Make Predictions
